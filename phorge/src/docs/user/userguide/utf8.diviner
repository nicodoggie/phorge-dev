@title User Guide: UTF-8 and Character Encoding

How Phorge handles character encodings.

= Overview =

Phorge stores all internal text data as UTF-8, processes all text data
as UTF-8, outputs in UTF-8, and expects all inputs to be UTF-8. Principally,
this means that you should write your source code in UTF-8. In most cases this
does not require you to change anything, because ASCII text is a subset of
UTF-8.

If you have a repository with source files that do not have UTF-8, you have two
options:

  - Convert all files in the repository to ASCII or UTF-8 (see "Detecting and
    Repairing Files" below). This is recommended, especially if the encoding
    problems are accidental.
  - Configure Phorge to convert files into UTF-8 from whatever encoding
    your repository is in when it needs to (see "Support for Alternate
    Encodings" below). This is not completely supported, and repositories with
    files that have multiple encodings are not supported.

= Support for Alternate Encodings =

Phorge has some support for encodings other than UTF-8.

NOTE: Alternate encodings are not completely supported, and a few features will
not work correctly. Codebases with files that have multiple different encodings
(for example, some files in ISO-8859-1 and some files in Shift-JIS) are not
supported at all.

To use an alternate encoding, edit the repository in Diffusion and specify the
encoding to use.

Optionally, you can use the `--encoding` flag when running `arc`, or set
`encoding` in your `.arcconfig`.
